# test desktop game
## Godot 4.3
don't expect much into it, it's just a game to test the possibilities. you may use this to make your own desktop assistant with Godot, but i'd prefer you don't as this code is not so well wrote, but hey, atleast you can use it for reference.

i learned with this project that i don't have to export the pck file apart from the executable, i can just use "Embedded PCK" option in export settings.

p.s. i've only tested this on Windows (the OS, yeh, pretty bad pun).
